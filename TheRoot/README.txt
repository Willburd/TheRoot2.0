===<THE ROOT>===
Ver. 2.0
RAIN WORLD v1.5
REGION EXPANSION 



[DESCRIPTION]
NOTICE! Be sure to backup your saves before installing! Having a clean save is recommended!

This mod adds a new region, with around 60 new rooms. This is a remake of the original Root,
as after a year of experience working on MSC I've seen just how much the original region was
lacking in design, theme coheasion, and just my general skill while making it!

However, even with all the changes, the region still holds to its original themes of just
adding more rainworld for fans to explore. As well as expanding routing options from The Wall
and Subterranean! Along with a new surprise gate location to replace the first version of the 
mod's connection into five pebbles. Which was removed due to being too daddy longleg focused,  
in a region that wasn't really connected to their theme too strongly. 




[LOCATION]
Spoilers of course: 
The Subterranean connection can be found towards the leviathan lake.
The Exterior's connection can be found at the west leg
The final connection can be found near the area before memory crypts




[INSTALL]
Simply merge the Assets and World folders of the mod, with the same folders in your Rain World 
install. It will ask to replace several files if done correctly.

It is recomended to install the Custom Regions mod, as passages will not function otherwise.

Attempting to install more than one region mod is a bit complex, but if the other region does not
have the same connections as the one you are trying to merge it with, it should be as simple as
dragging both into your install, and then ensuring both the "Rain World\World\Regions\regions.txt"
has both region prefixes present, and "Rain World\World\Gates\locks.txt" has the gate values of 
both mods present. You will need to do these last two steps manually, as your install will only 
have the data for the last region mod merged into it.
